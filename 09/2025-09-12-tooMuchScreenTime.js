/** The task:
 * Given an input array of seven integers, representing a week's time, 
 * where each integer is the amount of hours spent on your phone that day, 
 * determine if it is too much screen time based on these constraints:
    If any single day has 10 hours or more, it's too much.
    If the average of any three days in a row is greater than or equal to 8 hours, itâ€™s too much.
    If the average of the seven days is greater than or equal to 6 hours, it's too much.
 */

/** This was my original solution.
 * I wanted to do everything in one pass through the array because it is more efficient.
 * However, there is no need for that here because the array length is small and fixed (7).
 * So going through the array multiple times is not a big deal for performance,
 * plus it makes the code simpler and easier to read.
